Why learn about security ticketing? To learn about the various features of a security ticket, how security tickets can be resolved and what measures can be taken to follow-up.
It is essential to know how to maneuver a security ticketing platform as well as open, edit and close tickets within that platform. If in a general IT role, it can be beneficial
to apply the knowledge you currently have from your ticketing system and see the contrasts versus security ticketing.

Security Ticketing System: Similarly to a general IT ticketing system, any security-related events, incidents, alerts and inquiries can be tracked and addressed here by 
security personnel

Security Ticket: A document that contains the incident, alert, inquiry, etc that is used to keep track of the security team's activity and progress with resolving the issue

Security Alert: Notification/message about a security-related event and/or observation. Alerts are not tickets but they can lead to tickets being created. 
Alerts are typically generated by tools such as an email filtration system. The initial information given in an alert will help guide your investigation. Originating alerts
are the first alerts generated, for example an email received from a certain sender generates an alert from the filtration system then an alert is generated to the SOC.

Components of A Security Ticket
- Title
- Metadata (Ticket Info such as ticket ID or number, who it was created by, assigned to, when it was created, when it was last updated, etc)
- Description (Descriptors of the what, when, where, who of the incdent)
- Documentation (Notes help others understand your analysis of/progress with the ticket, can help newer analysts and yourself if you have the same issue again)
- Resolution Actions (Close, Escalate/Re-Assign, Pause/Hold) (Usual closure codes: duplicate, false positive, true positive, indeterminate, other; all of these codes are 
within theHive's ticketing platform) (escalations can happen if there is an analysis requires resources you don't have access to or a ticket contains a serious issue that
someone with the needed authority can perform containment actions)
